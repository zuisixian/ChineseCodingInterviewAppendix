I feel like I know how I’m going to feel before the final. I’ve been in this position before,” Alcaraz said. “I will try to do the things that I did well last year and try to be better.”\\nLike last year, his opponent in Sunday’s title match will be Novak Djokovic, who advanced with a 6-4, 7-6 (2), 6-4 victory against No. 25 seed Lorenzo Musetti. Djokovic won 15 of 16 points when he went to the net in the first set and finished 43 for 56 in that category. \\nIt’ll be the first time the same two men meet in consecutive Wimbledon finals since Djokovic beat Roger Federer in 2014 and 2015.\\n“He’s as complete a player as they come,” Djokovic said about Alcaraz, who won the 2023 final in five sets. “It’s going to take the best of my abilities on the court overall to beat him.”\\nDjokovic, who hadn’t reached a final at any tournament all season and needed surgery in June for a torn meniscus in his right knee, will be vying for his eighth championship at the All England Club. That would tie Federer’s mark for the most by a man — and put him one behind Martina Navratilova’s record of nine — while making the 37-year-old from Serbia the first player in tennis history with a career total of 25 Grand Slam titles.\\n\\n\\n“I know what I have to do,” Alcaraz said. “I’m sure he knows what he has to do to beat me.”\\nLate in Djokovic’s semifinal, as he let his first three match points slip away, fans hoping for a longer match began chanting “Lo-ren-zo!” One yelled out during a point, bothering Djokovic, who soon was wiping away fake tears mockingly after Musetti failed to convert a break chance in the last game.\\nThe No. 2-seeded Djokovic — who got a walkover in the quarterfinals when his opponent, Alex de Minaur, withdrew with a hip injury — eventually worked his way into his 10th final at Wimbledon and 37th at a major.\\n“I don’t want to stop here,” Djokovic said. “Hopefully I’ll get my hands on that trophy.”\\nMusetti said it didn’t look as if Djokovic was hampered at all by his knee, which was covered by a gray sleeve.\\n“He showed that he’s really in great shape, not only in tennis, but physically,” said Musetti, who was appearing in a major semifinal for the first time.\\nAfter a so-so opening set against Medvedev, Alcaraz transformed back into the energetic, attacking, crowd-pleasing force who already was the first teenager to be No. 1 in the ATP rankings and is the youngest man to have won a major trophy on three surfaces: grass, clay and hard courts.\\nNow the Spaniard is one victory away from joining Boris Becker and Bjorn Borg as the only men in the Open era, which began in 1968, with multiple championships at the All England Club before turning 22.\\nAlcaraz also triumphed at the U.S. Open in 2022 and the French Open last month and is 3-0 in major finals.\\n“We’re going to see a lot of him in the future, no doubt,” Djokovic said. “He’s going to win many more Grand Slams.”\\nOn a cloudy afternoon, the No. 3-seeded Alcaraz went through some ups and downs against No. 5 Medvedev, a 28-year-old from Russia.\\n“ I started really, really nervous,” Alcaraz said. “He was dominating the match.”\\nIndeed, Medvedev grabbed an early 5-2 lead, but then got into trouble with his play and his temper.\\nAlcaraz broke to get within 5-4 with a drop shot that chair umpire Eva Asderaki ruled — correctly, according to TV replays — bounced twice before Medvedev got his racket on the ball. He voiced his displeasure, and Asderaki, after climbing down from her seat to huddle with tournament referee Denise Parnell during the ensuing changeover, issued a warning to Medvedev for unsportsmanlike conduct.\\n“I said something in Russian. Not unpleasant, but not over the line,” Medvedev said at his news conference.\\nHe regrouped quickly and was just about perfect in that set’s tiebreaker.\\nThen it was Alcaraz’s turn to get headed in the right direction, which didn’t take long. He got the last break he would need for a 4-3 edge in the fourth when Medvedev sailed a backhand long, then sat in his sideline chair, locked eyes with his two coaches and started muttering and gesticulating.\\n“I was playing well,” Medvedev said, “and just it was not enough.”\\nNearly every time Alcaraz emitted one of his “Uh-eh!” two-syllable grunts while unleashing a booming forehand, spectators audibly gasped, regardless of whether the point continued. Often enough, it didn’t: Alcaraz had 24 forehand winners, 20 more than Medvedev.\\nIn addition to the Wimbledon men’s final, Sunday’s sports schedule features the final of the men’s soccer European Championship in Germany, where Spain will meet England.\\nWhen Alcaraz alluded to that in his on-court interview by saying, “It’s going to be a really good day for the Spanish people, as well,” he drew boos from the locals — perhaps his biggest misstep all day.\\nAlcaraz smiled and added: “I didn’t say Spain is going to win. I just said that it’s going to be a really fun, fun day.”\\n___\\nAP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis\\n\\n\\n\\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\\n'},\n",

A year ago in the Wimbledon final against Novak Djokovic, Alcaraz got off to a slow start, dropped the opening set and needed five to claim his first championship at the All England Club.\\nSunday’s rematch began with a game that felt monumental: 20 points across nearly 15 minutes, portending an engrossing, back-and forth contest — and a long one. There were moments of brilliance from both men. Alcaraz, though, was better. Just as he would be for nearly all of the next two hours.\\nAlcaraz learned from 2023 and applied those lessons to 2024, adding up to a 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (4) victory over Djokovic for a second consecutive Wimbledon championship and fourth Grand Slam title in all. And to think: He is still just 21.\\n“At the end of my career, I want to sit at the same table as the big guys,” said Alcaraz, who won the French Open last month and, after receiving Wimbledon’s gold trophy from Kate, the Princes of Wales, is now just the sixth man to triumph on the red clay at Roland Garros and the grass at the All England Club in the same season. “That’s my main goal. That’s my dream right now.”\\nAlcaraz improved to 4-0 in major finals, including at the 2022 U.S. Open; only Roger Federer got off to a better start to a career among men, going 7-0.\\nRELATED COVERAGE\\n  [![Image 52: Tomas Machac of Czech Republic celebrates after defeating Alejandro Davidovich Fokina of Spain in the final match at the Mexican Open tennis tournament in Acapulco, Mexico, Saturday, March 1, 2025.

Everything.”\\nFor Alcaraz, there was one brief blip, a five-point stretch that took him from the verge of victory to close to a collapse. It happened when he was a point from the championship while serving at 5-4, 40-love. But he double-faulted. Then missed a backhand. Then a volley. Then a forehand. And another forehand. Suddenly, it was 5-all. Suddenly, Alcaraz appeared rattled. Suddenly, Djokovic could hope.\\nSuddenly, there was intrigue.\\nBut only briefly. Alcaraz regrouped, got to the tiebreaker, then closed things out.\\nLast year, Djokovic recalled, “We went toe to toe.”\\n“This year,” he continued, “it was nothing like that. It was all about him. He was the dominant force on the court and deserved to win.”\\n  ![Image 55: Carlos Alcaraz of Spain plays a backhand return to Novak Djokovic of Serbia during the men's singles final at the Wimbledon tennis championships in London, Sunday, July 14, 2024.

He put a volley into the net to fall behind by a break to begin the second, then double-faulted to end that one. Finally, in the third, Djokovic perked up a bit, registering his only break of serve all day, as spectators chanted his two-syllable nickname — “No-le! No-le!” — while others replied with choruses of “Let’s go, Carlos! Let’s go!”\\nStill, this was not the body-contorting, get-to-everything Djokovic everyone is accustomed to seeing, which makes sense considering there were serious questions about whether it would be possible to even participate at Wimbledon.\\nAgainst Alcaraz, Djokovic occasionally hopped awkwardly when he landed after serving or stepped gingerly — as if barefoot on a beach’s hot sand — between points. Missing volleys he usually makes, Djokovic won just 27 of 53 points when he went to the net. After netting a volley to close one early 11-stroke exchange, Djokovic sighed and walked to his sideline seat to grab a purple-and-green towel for dabbing at sweat. His facial expression was saying: “Come on, Carlitos, pick on someone your own age.”\\nAlcaraz was outstanding in pretty much every way, from the basic to the sorts of shots no one else would even try. Once, he leaped and wrapped his racket all the way around his back to get the ball over the net, although Djokovic did put an overhead away to get that point. Alcaraz ran wide of the doubles alley for forehand winners. Claimed points via drop shots. Smacked serves at up to 136 mph (219 kph). Accumulated 14 break points, converting five, and faced just three.\\nWhat can’t Alcaraz do?\\n  ![Image 59: Carlos Alcaraz, left, of Spain is congratulated by Novak Djokovic of Serbia after winning the men's singles final at the Wimbledon tennis championships in London, Sunday, July 14, 2024.

Beat Carlos Alcaraz in the men’s singles final on Sunday and he will equal the feat of the men’s player who has become more synonymous with the All England Club than any other.\\nA hallmark of Federer’s popularity was his status as crowd favourite. He was so beloved that by the time he had won six titles, he even had the crowd on his side when he beat Andy Murray — bidding to become the first British player to win the men’s title in 76 years — in the 2012 final. It was the final now remembered for Murray’s tearful realisation that he was “getting closer”; the next year, he finally broke the hoodoo by beating none other than Djokovic in three sets.\\nAdvertisement\\nNow, 12 years on from Federer’s reversal of home advantage, Djokovic’s relationship with the Wimbledon crowd as he stands on the edge of history is rather more complicated.\\nAfter soundly and serenely beating Holger Rune on Monday, Djokovic accused the Wimbledon crowd of “disrespect“, believing that a large number of spectators had been booing him during the match. “Have a goooooooood night,” he said to the booers, even though the vast majority had been saying “Ruuuuuune” in support of his Danish opponent.\\n\\nDjokovic’s crowd interactions are frequently memorable (Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)\\nOn Friday, there were some boos when Djokovic celebrated his semifinal victory over Lorenzo Musetti by playing an imaginary violin (which was actually aimed at his daughter Tara, who is learning the instrument), but lots of applause followed during his on-court interview.\\nNowadays, Djokovic is generally liked and respected at Wimbledon, but on Sunday he faces defending champion Alcaraz, who has charmed the crowds with his Cheshire Cat smile and outrageous shotmaking ability. The majority of Centre Court were definitely on his side during last year’s final against Djokovic — this can partly be explained by tennis’s perennial cognitive dissonance when it comes to supporting underdogs — and as the 24-time Grand Slam champion chases the 25th, as well as Federer’s Wimbledon title count, he is likely to have the opportunity to fuel himself with a siege mentality once again.\\n\\nDjokovic has made an art out of defying hostile crowds, thriving on the antagonism. He did it against Federer on this very court in the 2019 final. He did it to the same player in the U.S. Open final of 2015, when there were moments in which an uncomfortably partisan crowd were barely cheering when Djokovic won points.\\n GO DEEPER The wisdom of crowds: Tricolores, trumpets, and truculence at Roland GarrosCrowd support in an individual sport is an intensely personal thing, rarely more so than in tennis and with Djokovic. He evokes strong feelings, positive and negative, and it’s easy to understand why any player will take the ensuing reactions from fans personally — especially a player who has achieved everything there is to achieve and more in tennis.\\nAdvertisement\\nThere are some curious elements.\\nOverwhelming favourites can often find themselves on the wrong side of fans when the only thing they have done “wrong” is winning too quickly. Crowds want as much tennis as possible, but they still want their favourite (often the player they are temporarily against) to win. Just, not too much. This has happened to Alcaraz and to women’s world No 1 Iga Swiatek, who have on occasions looked mildly bewildered by cheers when they lose a point after being roared to a convincing first-set win.\\n\\nAlcaraz, like Djokovic, knows how to harness crowd energy (Julian Finney/Getty Images)\\nSupport in tennis is not like football. Later on Sunday, Spain and England will be roared on by tens of thousands of fiercely patriotic supporters in the final of Euro 2024. Alcaraz will be one of them. But if John Stones heads the ball away England fans won’t be cheering because they like his playing style or how he comes across in interviews; they’ll be cheering because he’s English and he just headed the ball away.\\n GO DEEPER Carlos Alcaraz is a Wimbledon champion - and Spain's Euro 2024 good-luck charmDjokovic has a range of mechanisms for harnessing the energy of a tennis crowd. After defeating Federer in the 2019 final, he said, “When the crowd is chanting ‘Roger’, I hear ‘Novak’.”\\nOn Monday against Rune, he appeared to flip the script by imagining that lighthearted cheers for his opponent were something more sinister. A similar incident occurred against the same opponent at the 2021 U.S. Open. Djokovic’s musical talents also extend beyond the violin; he has added conducting crowds to his repertoire in recent years, including leading baying fans in his own chorus during a three-set defeat to Jannik Sinner at the 2023 ATP Finals in Turin.\\nAgainst Musetti on Friday, he used another of his favourite tactics — picking out a few spectators who were rooting for his opponent and zoning in on them. Feeding off negativity to try and defy the haters, real or imagined, has so often been his calling card.\\nOther players use this tactic too, including Djokovic’s friend Nick Kyrgios (on many occasions), Sebastian Korda at this year’s Italian Open in Rome, and Taylor Fritz, who shushed an entire stadium after beating Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech at Roland Garros in 2023.\\n\\nFritz silenced a baying Roland Garros crowd in 2023 (Anne-Christine Poujoulat/Getty Images)\\nAlcaraz also has his own soft factors to master. After beating Daniil Medvedev on Friday in four sets, he spoke of the difficulties he has faced in controlling the nerves he feels on court. These nerves are partly why he has lost the opening set in three of his six matches en route to the final, a run that stretches to four out of seven at Wimbledon if including last year’s final against Djokovic.\\nAdvertisement\\nOn that occasion, a clearly nervous Alcaraz lost the first five games of the match before belatedly settling into it. Djokovic, possibly the best frontrunner in the history of the sport, very rarely lets his opponent get away with losing the first set. He did last year, but Djokovic, competing in his 37th major final, has only twice before lost in back-to-back finals at the same Grand Slam tournament.\\nAlcaraz is aware of how desperately Djokovic wants to correct what happened in 2023, but he has generally also been the man for the big occasion in his short career so far. The 21-year-old is three from three in major finals.\\n\\nOn the court, much will depend on how both players serve. Alcaraz has struggled during the tournament, way down in the standings on first-serve points won. His 72 per cent puts him joint-68th in a tournament of 128 players — in the bottom half.\\nDjokovic is joint-sixth with 82 per cent, and he is in an even healthier fifth position for percentage of service games won (94 per cent), while Alcaraz is down at joint-60th with 83 per cent. IBM’s ‘Serve Quality’ ratings for this tournament have Alcaraz at 8.1 (the ninth-best of the 16 players who reached the fourth round) and Djokovic at 8.4 (fourth-best). The tournament average is 7.9.\\nAlcaraz has made up for this with his excellent returning. He’s joint-fourth for percentage of return games won, with 32 per cent, while Djokovic is joint-12th with 25 per cent. IBM’s ‘Return Quality’ rating has Alcaraz at 7.8 and Djokovic at 8.0, the fourth- and third-best scores for players who reached the fourth round, and way above the tournament average of 6.5.\\n\\nAlcaraz and Djokovic are meeting in the Wimbledon final for the second year in a row (Patrick Smith/Getty Images)\\nAlcaraz will need to keep up this level on Sunday, while also winning points from bad positions as well as ever. He has won more points while in defence (40.1 per cent) than anyone else in ATP Tour matches this year, but in the final he is facing a player far more comfortable when attacking at the net than his semifinal opponent Medvedev, or indeed most others on the tour.\\nDjokovic won 15 of 16 net points (94 per cent) in the opening set of his semifinal against Musetti, and 43 out of 56 (77 per cent) overall.\\nAdvertisement\\nA win for Djokovic on Sunday would take him clear of Margaret Court as the singles player with the most Grand Slam titles in tennis history, while extending the gap to Rafael Nadal on the men’s side, who is on 22. Djokovic has separated himself so far from the rest of the field that these numbers now have a feeling of inevitability, even though both Court’s titles and Federer’s eight Wimbledons are two of the most remarkable records in tennis history.\\nDjokovic has won four of the five Wimbledon men’s titles contested since 2018 (with the 2020 event cancelled) and only Alcaraz’s success 12 months ago prevented him from emulating Federer’s five successive wins, achieved between 2003 and 2007 at the peak of his “I’m-the-best-and-I-know-it” era of dominance on a surface that so perfectly suited his game.\\nDjokovic’s equivalent is the Australian Open, where the hard courts suit him and he has won a ridiculous 10 titles. His mastery of the grass has largely come from having the intelligence and versatility to remap his game to the surface, rather than an innate suitability. He has overcome difficulty in order to conquer — just as he perceives himself to do so often on court.\\nFor Djokovic, defying the haters to become the greatest ever at a place where he still feels some hostility would be deliciously on-brand.\\n(Top photo: Rob Newell/CameraSport via Getty Images)\\n\\nCharlie Eccleshare is a tennis writer for The Athletic, having previously covered soccer as the Tottenham Hotspur correspondent for five years.

for the second year in a row in the wimon final in three sets this time and there's just not enough amazing things to say about this kid he is big time he finds his best tennis in the biggest moments it was a very weird match it was not the match that I think a lot of us were hoping for as far as an epic jokovic didn't have the level in the first two sets and alarz absolutely pounced on him earlyer and just really got him up against the ropes but did get interesting in that third set alz squandered three Championship points actually four in total and jokovic almost started making people think he was having a comeback but alra slams the door we're GNA break it down what happened in this match what it means for the history of tennis what it means for alcra we're gonna get all into it this is the slice presented by betway thanks for being here let's get going oh my gosh there's just so much to talk about there the match the the records that alarz now has or the the record that he has in majors and against jokovic and all this it's just it's just nuts 21 years old we've I said it on Twitter I really think we've never seen anyone like him as a 21-year-old winning on all surfaces two wimbledon's now one French Open one US Open unreal if you're new here welcome to the slice I'm Stephen Bon I'm your host and I would love it if you subscribed because we are trying to get to 20,000 subscribers and you would help us out in doing that we just had a great live stream with our podcast co-host JP huy and a few special guests so you can go watch the recording of that we watched it all live and it was a match it went in a way how I expected because if you watch a previous video to this I called it I predicted alz in four he gets it done in three and a quick word for the haters if you thought it was just a jokovic hater because I picked ALR to win you're out to lunch literally last year at The Wimbledon final I predicted jokovic to win and alcr won so I picked jokovic or alcr this year because of logical reasoning and he won because he played the way I thought he would and he was too much for jokovic like I thought he was going to be so put some respect on the slice name we know what we're talking about we're now eight for 10 as far as videos when I make a video saying this guy will be this guy to win this eight out of 10 have been right the only times we've not gotten it right was the W 20123 Wimbledon final when I bet on sorry that was wrong earlier when I said uh the that about jokovic letting me down the only times I've lost is when I've bet against jokovic so I bet I I thought that um or no sorry I picked jokovic to win last year's Wimbledon I lost that one and I picked jokovic to win uh the 2022 rolling garos quarterfinal and Nadal got it done anyways enough of that this match was you know set up to be another epic like last year that's what we thought it was going to be but I did think my prediction at the beginning was that alcaras has been tested in this tournament alarz has played at a much higher level throughout all 20 24 than jokovic has jokovic had a very easy route to the final at wimbl this year at Wimbledon this year and I believe has not beaten a top 10 player all year so if you're thinking about it he doesn't have the level from this whole season or at this tournament and his knee has been compromised and I said that his movement was compromise because of it and that was true that was true so if we're going to just look at the stats first let's go through that the match goes 62 6276 the first two sets were a wrof Total alra Domination in the match though in general jovic's serve got much better in the third set and we'll look at that he got 70% of his first serves in in but only won 66% of those first serve points and only 40% of his second serve points alcarez was all over the Novak jokovic second serve another crazy stat is net points one jokovic came to net 53 times a lot not on his own accord and only won 51% of those whereas alra won 73% of his net points essentially because he came to the net almost every time on his own there's a few Dr jokovic drops shots but in general jokovic was trying to go big and Rush ALR and get on him because he needed to do that that's what I said um but the real story here is alcr 42 winners only 24 unforced errors compared to 26 and 25 for jok 42 winners and only 24 enforced errors the crazy thing is how at 21 years old are you able to go for so much play so aggressive and play great and not spray the ball at all he pretty much played a Flawless match until some part until the till the four five game in the third set where he was trying to serve it out got a little tight there got a little interrupted by the fans but made up for it like that is the craziest thing about alcr for me is is how he finds his best tennis in the biggest moments and that's just getting more and more and more reinforced um anyways that's a lot of winners to a lot of to a few on Forest errors let's break this down set by set with the stats set one out jokovic attacking more 30% to 23 for jokovic first first Ser in one by alarz but the problem here for jokovic was his he he wasn't getting any purchase he was attacking more and it wasn't helping him he only won 55% of his first serve points which is shocking 50% of his second Ser points only won four out of his 12 net points so he would come forward he would get pasted Joe alcat would drop shot him he would have to come forward and he would get pass or he would miss the volleys he missed a lot of volleys that he normally would make and he was pressing and going for a lot with his attacking tennis and missing like he normally wouldn't do so that's from the start of the match you felt like alarz was playing his game and jokovic was playing outside of his game and the first game of the match was pretty much like a punch in the mouth like stokovich serving super long service game couldn't get anything done it was pressing was missing alra was there just playing defense essentially and then alcra gets the break in the first game it's kind of like we uh we had we had uh Landry on the on the on the live stream he's an MMA fighter it's kind of like getting bopped in the nose right away in the fight like you're just reing all of a sudden and that's what it felt like jokic was doing so Carlos comes out plays great tennis 12 winners eight unforced SS in the first set won all of his net points broke twice jokovic did have a break point at one point point but alcr quickly got it put it away so that first set was 62 and you're like okay where's this going from here was that just a quick set is jokovic gonna be able to find his energy find his level and that was not to be the case the second set uh it continues in a very similar way jokovic gets a lot of first serves in but they're just not he's not winning points behind them he only won 60% of his first serve points whereas alra won eight 86% in the first two sets alra only lost four points on his first serve in the first two sets so it was like complete domination only lost one point at net out jokovic was less than 50% at net and ALR breaks twice again in the second set seven winners five unforced STS crazy just crazy level great level for alcr to not let jokovic get off the mat essentially and then jokovic going to the third set really started to press what he did do was start to press better sorry the stats AR on the screen he started jokovic started to play better he started to serve better Three Aces 77% of first serves in and in the third set he ended up winning 76% of his first serve points which is better which is you know where he needed it to be all match long but alcra still won 80% of his first serves was serving well and then following up his serve extremely well net points won still jokovic came to the net a lot then only won 58% of those alra eight for 13 break points one Jo alcra got one break so did jokovic we're going to talk about that but this is where it gets crazy as jokovic pressed alcaras as jokovic started to play better you would assume that alz would get tight and play worse but he didn't that's not what happened if you look at it he hit 23 winners to 11 unforced errors in the third set it's just it's like rising to the occasion in the most incredible way jokovic played better served better started turning the screws bringing the Heat and alra just responded with getting even better so I just don't know what else to say in so alcr has broken now is then serving for the match four five double fault I thought you know from last year where he got basically all first serves in in that final game we thought I wondered if it would be the same alra double faults and then I believe he hits an unforced error after that then it's 3040 and then alarz was going out wide hit a good out wide serve and there was like a floating return coming back and Joe alz goes to hit a swinging volley and someone from the crowd literally goes like screams as he's over to hit it and he pushes it about two inches wide Deuce jokovic goes on and ends up breaking and you're thinking oh my gosh jokovic is back and but when he gave jokovic gave that fist pump to me it wasn't like I'm back I'm winning this in five it was like like come on come on jokovic come on noie he was trying to will himself back and I'm sure all you jokovic fans were there with him trying to will him back into it but you could just feel he he started to play better there but he still didn't have what needed he needed to have to win this gets to the tiebreaker and then ALR plays a little more solid in the tiebreaker there was a point that jokovic went for the winner uh a shot up the line pressed it wide it was not a wise time to do that it gave alra the mini break which he ended up keeping and uh getting it done so yeah what a match what a turn a circumstance ALR really kind of destroys jokovic in this match in the first two sets jokovic didn't have the level and for the story you gotta wonder why you gotta wonder I mean but you don't really also he's 37 years old he's won everything there is to win in tennis and you have Carlos alarz who could go down like I was saying on the stream if he he's already in like the top 10 greatest tennis players of all time in my books like right there if he got hit by a bus tomorrow his career would be like better than many many many people in the Tennis Hall of Fame and he's 21 years old so jokovic has done everything there is eventually going to be a lack of motivation which this is obviously not it he doesn't lose motivation or he has I think in general after getting to 24 but when you're in a final versus a guy like Al CRZ there's no lack of motivation there to win but he is 37 years old and he has slowed down and his knee is not helping and alarz is fully pumped up fully confident and that's just leans in alr's favor which is why I predicted him to win this was not alr's first time in the major final he'd already won three he won the last one in the French Open this is not his first time facing jokovic in a major final or beating jokovic in a major final or beating jokovic in a Wimbledon final he did that last year so there was nothing about this final that was like new territory for alcra and that's why I didn't think the neres would get to him and they didn't and I thought there maybe would be a case because maybe he felt like he should win so he might feel nervous then but he's just way too confident alft is way too sure of himself he's absolutely a freak when it comes to the way he plays at 21 years the way he could just every time that jokovic was pressing and playing good shots algra could just come up with what was needed passing pass flicking it down the line lobbing hitting crazy volleys hitting Drop shots just absolutely nuts so yeah the records alra now 4-0 in major finals he's won all four of his first four majors the only one of the big three four to do that is Joe is sorry feder who won his Force first four m major finals as well he's the first alas is the first player to win his first two Wimbledon back to back since feder it's kind of an obscure stat but I honestly think grass could go end up being alr's best surface it's absolutely nuts how well he moves on it how well his creativity is kind of rewarded he just looks so natural on there four majors he's 21 years old what else is there to say I think I'm sorry to say is Italian fans but I think watching these matches he might not be number one in the books for now but I think it's pretty clear that ALR is the number one player in the world right now he's the man to beat when he's playing his best he's the man to beat and you know what else can you say I'd love to see CER come and prove us wrong at the US Open in the US Open hardcourt Swing but for right now alz is on top of the tennis world and if you know I understand if you're a jokovic fan this hurts for sure it's like you're seeing your man not be able to do what he used to do and I know what that feels like i' I'm a feder fan or I was a Federer fan and if we all go back to 2019 when jokovic ripped that wimbl in title away from Federer which was really Federer's last chance to get a title another major that was super painful for Federer fans I think you can now feel how feder fans felt jokovic fans and you even have it better jokovic has all the records he has 25 24 Majors he has the most weeks at number one but it still hurts but there should be no shame in this and you know most of everyone is respectful but there's so many people who are trashing feder when he lost that oh he choked he choked you know he's washed up he can never beat jokovic he was 39 years old jokovic was like 32 basically still in his prime jokovic is 37 now playing a 21y old so any argument that you want to be make why why Federer and all these older guys you know losing to these younger guys was an indicative of how great they were as tennis players is ridiculous feder jokovic losing this match doesn't affect his status in the history books of tennis at all he was always gonna eventually lose and if there's any player that he was going to do it to Carlos alra potentially the best 21y old tennis player of all time could do it so there's no shame in defeat for no fan there's no shame in defeat for jokovic but it is a Changing of the Guard by all accounts last year oneof yovic is like let's see it's not a full change in the guard I think this year in three sets in a pretty destructive win for alra over jokovic the guard has changed alra is the top dog and jokovic is no longer the favorite coming into Majors going forward he doesn't have more experience than other guys right now alarz has the most experience of just only winning when it gets to the final of Majors so we'll see where this goes we'll see how this plays out but this was an absolutely incredible performance from alarz couldn't talk more highly of it disappointing from jokovic for sure so well he's going to go to the Olympics and try and win gold for Serbia and we'll see maybe he retires after that I don't know where he goes from here but we were lucky today to watch another episode of two of the greatest tennis players of all time going at it one's 37 and has the most majors of all time one's 21 and has four out of four and we can only guess where he's going to go from now but we know it's going to be incredible anyways that's a recap that's an analysis that's a reaction of Carlos alarz winning Wimbledon over jokic again for his fourth major second Wimbledon absolutely incredible leave your thoughts below and if you were calling me a wanker or calling me any names for predicting this your apology will be accepted Below in the comment section we'll see you there\"}]"
